<a href="https://www.youtube.com/"target="_blank"title="html 유튜브">Winning a quadruple</a> of <strong>major <u>trophies</u> this season</strong> has
been described by many - including Liverpool's own players - as almost impossible.
But if they do achieve it, a significant
 reason for that will be the form of one man in recent
 weeks: Thiago Alcantara.</p>

 The Spain midfielder has stepped up at just the right
time for the Reds, producing man-of-the-match performances
 on an almost weekly basis as Jurgen Klopp's side chase
  success in the Premier League and Champions League to
   add to their FA Cup and League Cup wins.
